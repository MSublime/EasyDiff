# Features
- Allows comparing views, selections, multi-selections, and clipboard combinations.
- Can compare working copy against the base or previous revision of a file in SVN, Git, and Mercurial (requires some setup and configuration).
- Dynamic context menus for selecting left side and right side compare.  Dynamic menus show what file is on *left* side (think Beyond Compare context menus on windows).
- View diffs in a view buffer or output panel
- You can selectively hide version control menus or disable the command completely via the settings file.
- Can open diffs in external diff programs if desired (requires some setup and configuration)
- Show only internal diff options, only external options, or show both depending on your needs and preferences.
